This solution is just a learning area where I can practice the C# language features I may not use every day. 
Each project right now is currently a console app. Select any desired project as the startup project to be able to run it. 
I'm marking things that I want to learn/refresh on in the cSharpProjectPractice Program.cs, I'll add new projects as I cover more topics. 
I want to have a default learning area in source control where I can safely practice and try things out without worrying about messing up "real" work.
